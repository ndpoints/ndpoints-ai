## **About Endpoints AI**

**Endpoints AI** is an AI-powered platform that enables developers and architects to effortlessly generate microservices and backend solutions.

- **Report Issues**: Encountered a bug or unexpected behavior? Let us know!
- **Request Features**: Have a feature in mind that would improve your experience? Share it with us!
- **Provide Feedback**: Help us understand how we can improve Endpoints AI based on your experience.
